# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Lawrence

Iâ€™m a software engineer who builds things for the fun of it - tools, apps, libraries, experiments.  
Sometimes itâ€™s a voice-driven productivity app, sometimes itâ€™s a ride-hailing system with hardware integration,  
and other times, itâ€™s a library or a desktop recorder with auto-zoom.  

What ties it all together is curiosity. I love solving problems end-to-end, from idea to product.  
I care about design, speed, and making things that feel *solid*.  

I work across the stack â€” **Go**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, **React**, and anything that helps me ship.
