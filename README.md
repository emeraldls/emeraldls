# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Lawrence

Iâ€™m a product-focused software engineer who loves building tools that make people more creative and productive.  
I care about performance, design, and the small details that make software feel alive.

Iâ€™ve built AI-native and local-first products using **Go**, **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Python** â€” from desktop apps to real-time web tools, to integrating hardware, and infrastructure systems.  
Iâ€™m happiest when solving hard technical problems and turning them into simple, delightful user experiences.

Always exploring new ideas around **agents, voice interfaces, and local-first systems**.
